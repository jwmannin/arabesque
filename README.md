Minetest mod adding decorative nodes inspired by Arabic and Islamic archictecture and art

In development (more nodes to come!)--this is my first mod so any constructive criticism is welcomed.

#Depends 

This app depends on default and moreblocks for stairsplus compatibility. Currently crafts are still being written, so this mod should only be deployed on creative mode.

Also, glass-type nodes will not look as inteneded if connected glass is selected in setting
